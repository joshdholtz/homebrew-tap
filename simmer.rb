  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Fast mode (Quartz capture) requires macOS permissions:
        System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → simmer
        System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → rotate_sim (rotate fallback)

      Compat mode works without permissions but needs idb:
        brew tap facebook/fb && brew install idb-companion
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/simmer", "--help"
  end
end
